**Stock Market Analysis**

We created a script that looped through one year of stock data for each run and returned the total volume each stock had over that year.
* [Test Data](Resources/alphabtical_testing.xlsx) - We used this while developing our scripts.

* [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Scripts were used on this data to generate the final report.

The script also displays the ticker symbol to coincide with the total stock volume.
